What was accomplished:
-Finished putting together all the parts so that everything can run smoothly from image processing to producing the file that will be submitted to the competition.
-Set up Vagrant so that it will automatically start an EC2 instance on AWS.

Notes from meeting:
Talked mostly about how to scale up the image processing. 
Focus: AWS
Other options discussed: CCIS, multiple threads on personal computer

AWS notes:
Goal: Get images from S3 -> Process images -> Put output in S3
-Make sure to put any output generated back into S3. Do not leave any state on whatever box is used to process the images
-Split the data into smaller batches
-Consider using scripts to automate the process of setting up EC2, S3, and running the image processing
