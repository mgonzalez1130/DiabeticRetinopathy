1. Have program spit out the file needed for the competition (a .csv file where each line corresponds to a single test image. Each row has two columns, image_id and calculated_label)

2. Need to process the train and test images. Options:
-CCS servers
-Cloud (trying this option first)
-Multiple threads on local machine

3. Virtualization options:
-docker
-vagrant (trying this option first)

4. Start optimizing ML algorithm portion
-train multiple classifiers
-voting scheme
-correlations between data and algorithms?
