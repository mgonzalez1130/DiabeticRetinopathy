Project outline:

Step 1: Image Processing
Images -> Image Processing -> Data file (.csv)
Input: A set of images (and there labels)
Output: A csv file where each row represents the numerical feature vector obtained from processing an image. The last column is the label associated with that image.
Tools: ImageJ, FeatureJ (an ImageJ plugin)

Step 2: Train the machine learning model
Data file(.csv)-> Machine Learning Algorithm -> .model file
Input: A set of txt files 
Output: A file containing all the relevant information for the model trained using the ML algorithm, which will be used to predict labels for test images. A .model file can be generated using Weka.
Tools: Weka

Step 3: Test the machine learning model
.model File and Test Images -> CSV file of labels, print out of model stats
Input: A set of test images and the .model file generated in the previous step
Output: A CSV file containing the lables for all of the test images, as well as a print out of a set of statistics for the model describing the accuracy.

Step 4: Integrate hadoop and start using AWS
Tools: DistributedWekaHadoop

Step 5: Optimize (machine learning algorithms and image processing)
